# LaravelPlanetScale

[![Latest Version on Packagist][ico-version]][link-packagist]
[![Total Downloads][ico-downloads]][link-downloads]

This package adds a `php artisan pscale:migrate` command to your Laravel app which can be used instead of the normal `php artisan migrate` command when using a PlanetScale database.

## Installation

Via Composer

``` bash
composer require x7media/laravel-planetscale
```

## Configuration & Usage

1. Login to your PlanetScale account and get your Service Token and Service Token ID from the organaization settings. Also take a note of your organization name and production branch name as well for the next steps.

2. Add the following database level permissions to your Service Token for your app's database:

	- create_branch - Create a database branch
	- delete_branch - Delete a database branch
	- connect_branch - Connect to, or create passwords and certificates for a database branch
	- create_deploy_request - Create a database deploy request
	- read_deploy_request - Read database deploy requests

3. From the database settings screen on PlanetScale, click the checkmark to enable the "Automatically copy migration data" settings. Select "Laravel" from the migration framework dropdown and it should fill it "migrations" for the migration table name. Then save the database settings. This will allow migration status to be synced across PlanetScale database branches.

4. Setup the following enviroment variables in your app with the appropriate values:

`PLANETSCALE_ORGANIZATION=`

`PLANETSCALE_PRODUCTION_BRANCH=`

`PLANETSCALE_SERVICE_TOKEN_ID=`

`PLANETSCALE_SERVICE_TOKEN=`

Additonally yuou'll need to make sure your database name is set under:

`DB_DATABASE=`

**OR**

Optionally you can publish the config:

``` bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=laravel-planetscale-config
```

Then customize the values in the config. **NOTE:** If you take this approach we *STRONGLY RECOMMEND* that you still use enviroment variables or some other secrets storage at least for your service token and service token ID for security.

5. Replace the `php artisan migrate` command in your deployment script or process with this:

``` bash
php artisan pscale:migrate
```

**NOTE:** The `pscale:migrate` command supports the same options are Laravel's built in migration command, and will pass those options along to it when it gets to that step in the process.

## FAQ's

### Why is this necessary?

PlanetScale has a lot of advantages when using it as your application's production database. When [safe migrations](https://planetscale.com/docs/concepts/safe-migrations) are enabled, you cannot run direct schema changes against your production database branch. Instead, you use the branching flow and Vitess's [non-blocking schema migration](https://planetscale.com/docs/concepts/nonblocking-schema-changes) tooling to run your database migrations safely.

This is accomplished by creating a branch of your schema, running your migrations against that branch and then opening a deploy request to have PlanetScale manage the schema migration for you in production.

This package uses [PlanetScale's Public API](https://api-docs.planetscale.com/) to automate the process of creating a new development branch, connecting your app to the development branch, running your Laravel migrations on the development branch, merging that back into your production branch, and deleting the development branch. You end up with the best of both, the migration flow you are used to while also taking advantage of PlanetScale's schema migration tools.

### Are there any notable limitations to PlanetScale's branching?

Yes, there is one **BIG** caveat. That is branching and merging is for *schema only*. So you will need to separate your schema migrations from your data migrations. Use this to run your schema migrations and run your data migrations separately against your production branch.

An alternative method is to disable [safe migrations](https://planetscale.com/docs/concepts/safe-migrations) on your production branch, then you can mix schema and data migrations. Then when that is finished re-enable safe migrations to return to using the safe schema change tools.
